    "### Dataset overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides medical insurance information for individual clients from the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "- Solidify my understanding of data analysis concepts by exploring the real-world dataset.\n",
    "- Formulate exploratory questions that uncover meaningful patterns in the dataset - for example, compare the costs of insurance between smokers and non-smokers. At this stage, it is not important to evaluate if my questions are strong, but to generate ideas freely as I will revisit them in the future when my analytical skills are stronger\n",
    "- Begin to practice how to interpret findings even if the conclusions are tentative. The aim is to build the habit of turning observations into meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic exploratory questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How many *records* are there in the dataset?**\n",
    "> This is the most basic information to find out in the dataset. This establish an understanding of how large the dataset is and the result can be useful for downstream percentage-based calculations. \n",
    "- **What are the unique values or categories for categorical variables such as `region`, `sex`, `smoker`? and even numerical varibles with limited values like `children`**?\n",
    "> This step helps define the structure of each categorical variables. Knowing all the possible values each variable can take is essential for downstream tasks such as analyzing the *distribution within a variable* or category-based *aggregations* (e.g., group by `region` or the smoker `status`).\n",
    "> Although `children` is a numerical variable, its small number of distinct values (e.g., 0 - 9) makes it suitable for grouping and aggregation like a categorial variable.\n",
    "- **What are the distributions within such categories?** (e.g., how many people in the dataset are a smoker and how many are not)\n",
    "> Examining the distribution allows me to understand which group dominates the dataset(e.g., whether most clients are male or female, or which region is most represented).\n",
    "> These distributions also support downstream tasks such as percentage-based calculations and subgroup comparisons and aggregations.\n",
    "- **What are the mean (average) values for numerical variables such as `age`, `children`, `charges`, and `bmi`?**  \n",
    "> Calculating the mean helps establish the central tendency of each variable in the dataset.  \n",
    "> It is important to interpret the mean as a reference point — not as the most likely value, but as a mathematical center. To better understand the shape and spread of the data, I plan to explore additional metrics such as *median*, *mode*, and *standard deviation* as I continue learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Ideas for further exploration:\n",
    "- What are the proportions of smokers and non-smokers in the population?\n",
    "- What is the average BMI of a typical smoker compared to a non-smoker?\n",
    "- What is the avereage charges of a typical smoker compared to a non-smoker? \n",

    "- Which region has the highest avereage insurnace costs?\n",
    "- Which region has the most smokers?\n",

    "- What are the average chargess of these two groups?\n",
